# Pointer Family — Core Operators

This family documents the fundamental pointer operators in C.  
Every lab is structured as: definition → execution → traps → variations → checklist.

## Index

- **s01 — `&` (address-of)**
  - [lab001_address_of.md](s01-amperstand-&/lab001_address_of.md)

- **s02 — `*` (asterisk / deref)**
  - [lab001_asterisk_of.md](s02-asterisk-*/lab001_asterisk_of.md)

- **s03 — `->` (arrow / member through pointer)**
  - [lab001_arrow_of.md](s03-arrow-->/lab001_arrow_of.md)

## Next Planned Operators

- `[]` → pointer + array indexing equivalence
- `typedef *` → type alias pointer pitfalls
- `void*` → generic pointer labs
- function pointers (`int (*f)(int)`)
